## Checkout Pull Request change locally
If you want to check change on a pull request, but can't or don't want to fetch the change from a remote branch (for whatever reason). You can directly pull the change from the upstream branch with ID of the PR, check out [Github Instruction](https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/)
_**Note:**_ Make sure you use a new branch, or the change may be reject.
