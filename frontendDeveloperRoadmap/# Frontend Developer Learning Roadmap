# Frontend Developer Learning Roadmap

The [Frontend Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) provides a "Step by step guide to becoming a modern frontend developer" (In Their Own Words). If one has a good understanding of recommended topics on this road map, he is a good engineer; if one master most topics on this list, he is definietly a frontend master.

My goal is following this list and become a better engineer.
